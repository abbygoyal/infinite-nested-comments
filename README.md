Build a inifnite nested comments system using react js

Comments are a common feature in many applications. Nested comments are a more advanced feature that allows users to reply to comments. You might have seen nested comments on platforms like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter.

It is a good practice to use recursion to create nested comments. Basically, we will create a component that renders a comment and then calls itself to render the replies to that comment. This way, we can create a tree-like structure of comments.
